This game is a computer game just like the popular platform game Mario. It is called “Tomrun”. It is not an online game and players are able to play the computer game and their scores and other details will be saved only on their various computers. It is not a multiplayer game. Players can load and continue from the stage in which they stopped or failed. Due to the nature of the game, the graphics was done in 2D and offer a layout and feel similar to that of the Mario game.

NOTE: To view the game and be able to play it, open the .swf file with an application that supports it, most preferable a Flash player. Enjoy :).
